A **piscine** is a structured program split into small daily projects to learn a language, paradigm, or technology. It requires consistent effort and collaboration.

## Project List:
Projects must be completed in the following order:

1. **Cybersecurity - arachnida** (Web): Build tools to interact with web environments, including tasks like web scraping or interaction simulations.
2. **Cybersecurity - ft_otp** (OTP): Implement a one-time password system for secure authentication.
3. **Cybersecurity - ft_onion** (Web): Develop features inspired by layered security models, such as onion routing.
4. **Cybersecurity - Reverse me** (Rev): Analyze and reverse-engineer a given program or binary file.
5. **Cybersecurity - Stockholm** (Malware): Explore concepts behind malware design, focusing on payload structure and analysis.
6. **(Optional)** Cybersecurity - Iron Dome (Malware): Study and implement defensive mechanisms against advanced malware attacks.
7. **Cybersecurity - Inquisitor** (Network): Work with network monitoring and inspection tools to detect vulnerabilities or suspicious activities.
8. **Cybersecurity - Vaccine** (Web): Develop web-based solutions to neutralize or mitigate cybersecurity threats.

Each module builds on the previous, so validation must follow this sequence.
